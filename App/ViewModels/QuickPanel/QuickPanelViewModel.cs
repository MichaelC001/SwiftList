// are visible and in what order, and what each group is called. Loading a source's entries is
// QuickPanelSourceLoader's job, and both it and the settings arrive through the constructor so the
// assembly logic here can be tested without an index behind it.
//
// See QuickPanelViewModelLoading for what a refresh actually loads, QuickPanelViewModelFilter for the
// box at the top, and QuickPanelViewModelWriteback for the two things the strip writes back.
